# Integrated Ticket System Documentation

## Overview

The integrated ticket system provides a seamless experience for booking, viewing, and managing bus tickets with QR code functionality. The system supports both regular tickets and enhanced QR tickets with government compliance features.

## System Architecture

### ðŸ“± Screen Flow
```
Booking â†’ Payment â†’ QR Ticket (Enhanced) / My Tickets (Regular)
                â†“
My Tickets â†’ Ticket Detail â†’ QR Ticket (Enhanced View)
```

### ðŸŽ« Ticket Types

1. **Regular Tickets** - Basic ticket information from API
2. **Enhanced Tickets** - Full QR data with government signatures and compliance

## Key Components

### 1. My Tickets Screen (`my_tickets_screen.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Main ticket management interface
- **Features**:
  - Tabbed view (Active, Expired, All)
  - Pull-to-refresh functionality
  - Error handling with retry
  - Floating action button for new bookings
- **Navigation**: `/my-tickets`

### 2. Ticket Detail Screen (`ticket_detail_screen.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Detailed view of individual tickets
- **Features**:
  - Screen protection for active tickets
  - QR code button for enhanced view
  - Complete ticket information
  - Journey, fare, and booking details
- **Integration**: Converts regular tickets to enhanced for QR display

### 3. QR Ticket Screen (`qr_ticket_screen.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Enhanced QR ticket display
- **Features**:
  - Animated ticket card design
  - Secure QR code generation
  - Government compliance information
  - Copy ticket number functionality
  - Status indicators and validation codes

### 4. Ticket Screen (`ticket_screen.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Legacy redirect to My Tickets
- **Function**: Automatically redirects to `/my-tickets`

## API Integration

### Ticket Data Structure
The system handles API responses with this structure:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "ticket_id",
      "bus_id": "bus_id",
      "route_id": "route_id",
      "boarding_station_id": "station_id",
      "destination_station_id": "station_id",
      "booking_time": "2025-10-21T16:56:32+05:30",
      "valid_until": "2025-10-22T16:56:32+05:30",
      "status": "booked",
      "final_amount": 50,
      "qr_token": "...",
      "government_signature": "...",
      "validation_code": "VAL_123456"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Enhanced Ticket Conversion
Regular tickets are converted to enhanced tickets for QR display:
- Uses `MockTicketService.createMockEnhancedTicket()`
- Preserves original ticket data
- Adds QR compliance features
- Generates government signatures and validation codes

## Booking Flow Integration

### Payment Screen Updates
1. **Dual Booking Strategy**:
   - Attempts enhanced booking first
   - Falls back to regular booking on failure
   - Navigates to appropriate screen based on result

2. **Navigation Logic**:
   ```dart
   if (enhancedTicket != null) {
     // Show QR ticket with full features
     Navigator.pushReplacement(context, QrTicketScreen(ticket: enhancedTicket));
   } else {
     // Show tickets list
     Navigator.pushReplacementNamed(context, '/my-tickets');
   }
   ```

## State Management

### Ticket Provider Integration
- **Regular Tickets**: `loadMyTickets()` from API
- **Enhanced Tickets**: `bookEnhancedTicket()` for new bookings
- **State Handling**: Manages both ticket types in unified state

### Error Handling
- Network errors with retry functionality
- Graceful fallbacks between ticket types
- User-friendly error messages
- Offline ticket creation option

## User Experience Features

### ðŸŽ¨ Visual Design

'/ticket'     â†’ TicketScreen()           // Redirects to my-tickets
